    <p>Hi! I’m Godoy, a Mechatronics Engineer and passionate educator transitioning into the world of data science. I’ve worked in industry and academia, teaching university students topics like automation, electronics, and thermodynamics while solving real-world problems with code and systems thinking.</p>

    <p>This website is both my portfolio and an educational resource. I’m currently building data analysis projects in SQL, Excel, and Python—and producing teaching content on YouTube to help others learn complex topics in a simple way.</p>

    <p>My goal is to bridge engineering intuition with data-driven decision-making, and to grow into a skilled data analyst while staying connected to teaching and tech communication.</p>
